# ATMBankMachine
This application simulates how a ATM machine works with remote banking servers

- Features included in our software are:
* Cash withdrawal
* Cash deposit
* Create Cheque
* Fund Transfer
* Account Inquiry 
* Pessimistic Concurrency Control (Locking)

Also I added the ability for other applications to connect to it and make payments as if they were retailers.
For example my Inventory Car parts application at [link to Inventory app](https://github.com/Kerschel/Inventory-Management-using-RMI) can be connected to it and make sales.
